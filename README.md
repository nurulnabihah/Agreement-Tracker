## Introduction
This is my practicum project called Agreement Tracker build in Jira.
The purpose of this project is to make it easy for Compliance, Risks, Legal and Shariah (CARLS) team to track on all of the Center of Digital Experience (CDX) agreements.

Before this project existed, the person in charge of the agreement renewal, manually updated all the agreements into the Excel sheet as shown in image below.
![Old Agreement](https://github.com/nurulnabihah/Agreement-Tracker/blob/main/images/Old%20Agreement.jpg)

There are about fifty agreements in the Excel sheet that consist of agreement information such as 
- the name of the vendor 
- name of the agreement 
- commencement date 
- expiry date 
- remarks 

Each of this information was included in this project as well as additional information as needed by the CDX legal team.
For the agreement that was neared the expiration date, the person in charge needs to ask the team that is responsible for that agreement to determine whether to continue with the service provided by the vendor or terminate the agreement. No response from the CDX side usually means the team is not continuing the service provided by the vendor. This is why this project is important because each of them must be recorded for action to be taken before the
agreement reaches its expiration date. The function of this project is including CRUD, and sending notification to users email to remind on agreement renewal and performance review date.
